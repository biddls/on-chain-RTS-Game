<h1>Alchemix DAO game</h1>

<h3>You can check it out [here](https://master.dsk3l68c4lifn.amplifyapp.com/) on Rinkeby </h3>

This is a fully on chain, L2, topdown RTS, time delayed game, that will use the DAO NFT's as items in the game, so by 
voting in the dao 
you can earn the NFTs to use in the game. the game currently only has 4 main parts:
1. Map tile redemption you can take your NFT from the DAO and redeem a map tile of that ID type
2. Magic attacks using the ID number of the NFT you can only attack tiles that are of the same IDas your NFT (any 
   NFTs used in the attack can be bought back for ALCX)
3. Permanently changing the layout of the map if you successfully attack or fail to defend an attack the tile is 
deleted forever (as long as the whole map stays together)

In the future I intend to add with community involvement and feedback:
1. Use of Materia shards to recruit units to invade other tiles
2. Building of structures on tiles to give them certain attributes (walls or research facilities or recruitment of 
   certain units)
3. Your proportional economic output from your kingdom will give you voting rights in the games ALCX that is staked in 
   the DAO and mby other rewards down the line
4. Time delay so any move against your kingdom you have a chance to defend and pre-pare for it

<h3>What I am asking from the DAO</h3>
I would like X amount of money to hire a React developer to build out a better website as, although I 
have tried to make progress on my end I am not very good at react

<h3>What the DAO will receive</h3>
This proposal is just to build out a better looking UI instead of the eyesore that I have currently developed. With 
a better UI I hope to be able to more effectively communicate the vision and start to generate more involvement and 
feed back from the community about the game.
