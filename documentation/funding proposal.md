<h1>Alchemix DAO game</h1>

You can check it out [here](https://master.dsk3l68c4lifn.amplifyapp.com/) on Rinkeby

This is a fully on chain, L2, topdown RTS, time delayed game, that will use the DAO NFT's as items in the game, so by 
participating in the dao you can earn the NFTs to use in the game. The game currently only has 4 main parts:
1. Map tile redemption you can take your NFT from the DAO and redeem a map tile of that ID type
2. Magic attacks using the ID number of the NFT you can only attack tiles that are of the same ID as your NFT
3. Permanently changing the layout of the map if you successfully attack or fail to defend an attack the tile is 
deleted forever (as long as the whole map stays together)

In the future I intend to add with community involvement and feedback:
1. Use of Materia shards to recruit units to invade other tiles
2. Building of structures on tiles to give them certain attributes (walls or research facilities or recruitment of 
   certain units)
3. Your proportional economic output from your kingdom will give you voting rights in the games ALCX that it has in 
   the DAO and mby other rewards down the line
4. Time delay so any move against your kingdom you have a chance to defend and pre-pare for it
5. Allowing shrimp to "work" for the whales to the benefit of both
6. Creating economic incentives in a play to earn aspect above and beyond rewards from the games accrued ALCX and 
   the voting rights you receive
7. Any NFTs used in the magic attack can be bought back for ALCX from the game
8. How to ensure that whales do not ruin the fun for everyone (reputation system; bonding vurve the more you own the 
   harder it gets)
9. Make sure its fun and engaging

<h3>What I am asking from the DAO</h3>
I would like X amount of money to hire a web developer to build out a better website as, although I have tried to 
make progress on my end I am not very good at react.

<h3>What the DAO will receive</h3>
This proposal is just to build out a better looking UI instead of the eyesore that I have currently developed. With 
a better UI I hope to be able to more effectively communicate the vision and start to generate more involvement and 
feed back from the community about the game.

<h3>Why this is good for the DAO and the ALCX token holders</h3>
After a magic attack all the NFTs are sent to the game which it either stakes in the DAO to build a better character 
for more rewards or they are then sold back to the community for ALCX which is then locked up in the game 
permanently and sent off to the DAO. This ALCX will never be sold (unless needed for slashing) and the materia 
shards it generates will be distributed to the players of the game as a reward for playing. Voting in the DAO with 
the games ALCX will be done by how many map tiles you own, so owning more of the map will grant you more power in 
the DAO it will be a winner take all scenario in terms of the voting weighting.
